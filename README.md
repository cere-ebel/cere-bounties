# Cere Bounty Program
Here, you can find information about the Cere bounty program. In this repo you'll find specifications and information about different bounties. Bounties are items/features/deliverables that are identified by the Cere team to be relavant and valuable for the Cere ecosystem, to be developed by our community.

As we want to build and expand the Cere ecosystem together with our community, the bounty program helps the community to participate in feature development, bug fixing, testing, etc.

In the [Issues page](https://github.com/cere-ebel/cere-bounties/issues), you can find all open bounties with the necessary information you'll need to get you started. 

If you need more help/information, please join our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/w2c2a5Rgy6). 

*The bounty program is still a work in progress, so please bare with us*

## How to get involved

## Rewards
Every bounty will have a different reward. Rewards are specified on the bounty page. When you're eligible for a reward, rewards will be paid in CERE tokens to your Cere wallet, on the Cere Mainnet.

The amount of the reward will depend upon the amount of work and complexity of the bounty and are, for now, determined by the Cere team.

Please take into account that different bounties may have different ways to pick a bounty 'winner'. Some bounties may reward multiple people based on who best completed a certain acceptance criterea, some bounties may pick the #1, #2, #3 winner, other bounties may just pick one winner, etc.
